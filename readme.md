  - âœ… Directed Graph (Adjacency List)
- **Traversal** (`Traversal.cpp`)
  - âœ… Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - âœ… Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Cycle Detection** (`CycleDetect.cpp`)
  - âœ… Cycle Detection in Undirected & Directed Graphs (using DFS)
- **Shortest Path** (`Dijkstra.cpp`)
  - âœ… Dijkstra's Algorithm (for Weighted Graphs)
